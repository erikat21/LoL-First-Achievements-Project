# League of Legends First Achievements Analysis
Author: Erika Tong

# Introduction

## General Introduction

This is a data science project conducted at UCSD which examines a professional 
data set developed by Oracle's Elixir and contains over 10,000 League of Legends 
competitive matches from 2022. In this project there are various states of analysis 
starting with exploratory data analysis including the missingness of values, then 
hypothesis testing, creating models for a prediction problem, and concludes with 
a fairness analysis. The primary focus of the project is to investigate the 
significance of the first achievements gained throughout the game and its impact 
on outcomes.

League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena game developed by 
Riot Games and played by millions worldwide. In the game there are many first 
achievements that can be gained by a side including "first blood", "first dragon",
"first herald", "first baron", "first tower", and "first midtower". These achievements
can set the tone throughout the match and holds significant weight in the outcome 
of the match.

The central question I am interested in investigating is: **How does gaining the 
first achievements (first blood, first dragon, first herald, first tower, first 
baron, first midtower) impact the outcome?** I will build a prediction model to 
predict the outcome of a match. This model holds potential to enhance teams 
strategic planning, gaming insights, and performance analysis by predicting outcomes
based on the teams historical data.
